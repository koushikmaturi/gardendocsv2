## What is Garden?

Garden is the fastest Bitcoin bridge and enables cross-chain Bitcoin swaps in as little as 30 seconds. It is built using an intents based architecture with trustless settlements, ensuring zero custody risk for the users.

Garden has facilitated over a billion dollars in volume and stands out from other bridges due to these [benefits](fundamentals/benefits/).

## Use Cases[​](https://docs.garden.finance/#use-cases) <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

#### [Swap​](https://app.garden.finance/swap/) <a href="#swap" id="swap"></a>

* [How to swap BTC to WBTC](https://docs.garden.finance/home/basics/guides/btc-wbtc)
* [How to swap WBTC to BTC](https://docs.garden.finance/home/basics/guides/wbtc-btc)

#### Build[​](https://docs.garden.finance/#build) <a href="#build" id="build"></a>

Garden is a community-driven project that encourages and appreciates developers' use of its composable dev stack to build cool Bitcoin cross-chain experiences. If you're a developer looking to integrate or build on Garden, these are good places to start:

* [SDK](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/sdk/): A simple guide to using the Garden SDK.
* [Cookbook](https://docs.garden.finance/cookbook/): If you're looking for some inspiration, you can find the projects cooked up by our devs and partners here! _chef's kiss_ To get your hands dirty in Garden (pun intended), check out the [Developers](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/) section.

#### Provide​ <a href="#provide" id="provide"></a>

Provide liquidity to Garden and earn fees by becoming a [solver](fundamentals/introduction/solvers.md) for the Garden protocol. If you are interested, reach out to us in the townhall to discuss the next steps.

#### [Stake](https://app.garden.finance/stake/)[​](https://docs.garden.finance/#stake) <a href="#stake" id="stake"></a>

Garden's [staking](fundamentals/introduction/stakers.md) system creates a game-theoretic mechanism to maintain solvers' integrity and incentivise long term [**SEED**](governance/token.md) commitment with native Bitcoin rewards.
